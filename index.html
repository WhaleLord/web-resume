		<h3>Dear pal,</h3>
		<p>This is to hard for me to say in person. I want you to know that Yes it's all your fault. I don't want you to be upset. This is hard for me to. We were the Best of pals. Yes you read it right I said were. I'm writing this to you to tell you We are no longer pals. We no longer more will share stories on those sweet Sunday mornings. We will no longer greet the day together. We will no longer walk side-by-side. Yes I know it's hard for me as well... This letter is the hardest thing I have done in my life so far. You may be asking why we're no longer pals. Well I wrote a poem to tell you why. I feel like it's the easiest way to tell you. After you read it and think "I can fix this" well don't think it. You'll will never fix the hole that was left in my heart. This is good bye FOREVER my sweet ex pal.</p>
